The Project contains the following:
- data [the already downloaded CIFAR-10 data]
- Assignment_2_a1760705.ipynb [The assignment notebook]
- results_and_model [The accuracy results and models obtained at when each candidate is produced during manual grid search]
Note : please create the directory "result_and_model" in the same level as notebook before running the saving code blocks
Note :  if directory "result\_and\_model" exists in the same level as notebook then notebook can be run as usual
Note : in the above section although it was said the code can be directly be run from "Load the variables" section, however its is recommended to clean the directory "result\_and\_model" in case of error and run the notebook from the beginning (because downloading from git may tamper with the file, git clone may not damage the file)
